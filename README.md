# Hi, this is my first automotive test-suite
## It created with webdriver.io+mocha framework 
### __I was learning how to do it on Vadym Morozov free course:__ 
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSQxQpIlVgo&list=PLP1-M5OhC7yjAZ1-llDH45nxLfKKbcxGe

This test-suit created as my final home-work 
It tests some SignIn and SignUp fetures 
Also it tests some user stories 

More details like test-cases I will add later;)

To run this test-suit you need only have last version of Node.js and Git
 * Download this code or import it (git clone)
 * Navigate to project folder in terminal 
 * Instal dependencies:

    ```
    npm i
    ``` 
 * Change test data (UserName, and user password in the signup.page.js)
 * In the project folder use:

    ```
   npm test
    ```

    to run tests.
